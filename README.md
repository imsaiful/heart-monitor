# ZephyrLogger

ZephyrLogger connects to the Zypher HxM heart rate monitor and logs the data from the device directly to a text file. This allows for in depth analysis of the heart rate data.

The data formats are available on the Zephyr website in the [api guide](https://www.zephyranywhere.com/media/download/hxm1-api-p-bluetooth-hxm-api-guide-20100722-v01.pdf).

## Downloading

You can install ZephyrLogger through the F-Droid open source app store, or you can download the APK directly [here](https://github.com/ianmcxa/ZephyrLogger/releases/download/v0.1/ZephyrLogger-0.1.apk).
