This file shortly describes the differences between the pyebrook implementation and this project.

MainActivity:
 *) Uses code from the file called hxmDemo.java (in pyebrook project)
 *) Moved display HrmReading functionality from the HrmReading class into MainActivity.
 +) Added functionality for storing data from Zephyr HxM BT as a file in the external storage. 

HrmReading:
 *) Moved the HrmReading class to a separate file.
 *) Removed display functionality from HrmReading class, which is now handled by the activity class (MainActivity).
 *) Added a toString() method, which returns the HrmReading in CSV format.
